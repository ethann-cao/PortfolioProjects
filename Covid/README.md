# COVID Data Analysis Portfolio Project [https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/edit/master/public/data]

## About

The COVID Data Analysis Portfolio Project delves into the exploration of COVID-19 data, aiming to understand key aspects such as deaths and vaccination progress. The ongoing global pandemic has prompted a need for comprehensive analysis to derive insights into the impact of the virus and the effectiveness of vaccination efforts.

## Purposes Of The Project

This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data to gain insights into the number of deaths and the progress of vaccinations. By utilizing SQL queries, we can extract valuable information from the dataset and derive meaningful conclusions.

### Exploring Analysis List

1. **Deaths Analysis:**
   - Identify trends and patterns in COVID-19-related deaths.
   - Analyze the distribution of deaths across regions or countries.

2. **Vaccination Progress:**
   - Explore the progress of COVID-19 vaccinations.
   - Analyze vaccination rates over time and across different locations.

## Running the Analysis

To explore the detailed analysis and findings, check out The [Covid Portfolio Project.sql](https://github.com/ethann-cao/PortfolioProjects/blob/Master/Covid/Covid%20Portfolio%20Project.sql)

```sql

-- Using CTE

With PopvsVac(Continent, Location, Date, Population, new_vaccinations, RollingVaccination) 
as 

-- Total Population vs Vaccinations
( 
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(Cast(vac.new_vaccinations as int)) OVER (Partition by dea.location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingVaccination

From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths$ dea
Join PortfolioProject..CovidVaccinations$ vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date

Where dea.continent is not null

)

Select *, (RollingVaccination/Population)*100 as PopulationPercentVaccinated
From PopvsVac

```
