## Approach Used

1. **Data Wrangling:** This is the first step where inspection of data is done to make sure **NULL** values and missing values are detected and data replacement methods are used to replace, missing or **NULL** values.

> 1. Import kaggle database

> 3. Select columns with null values in them. There are no null values in our database as in creating the tables, we set **NOT NULL** for each field, hence null values are filtered out.

2. Generated some new columns from existing ones.

> 1. Add a new column named `adjusted_user_rating`, the current user rating system was out of 10, making it difficult to compare to the critic score.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3. **Conclusion:**
